# Customized Anime Recommendation for Users

Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews 

-  Analysis of the anime (Japanese animation) dataset from Kaggle using Microsoft Excel, MySQL and Tableau.
-  The goal of the analysis is to create an anime recommendation system for the users based on exploratory analysis of popularity, gender, genre (action, comedy, fantasy), animation and story of the animes. 
-  Insights: Male users are more proactive in rating an anime than female users by 36%. The most liked genre is comedy. Users give a higher rating to an anime if it has a good story, animations and enjoyment factor. 
-  Used Tableau to create visualizations for the above insights and presented it to various stakeholders.
